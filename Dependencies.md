Dependency handling for Zoop 1.50


# Details #

Dependency handling is as follows:

Zoop has no external dependencies except PHP itself.  If we use an external library we include that library with Zoop and make sure
that it is fully integrated.  This gives the user a much better out of box experience when he downloads Zoop.

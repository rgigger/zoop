= Introduction =

Originally we planned to maintain compatibility with PHP 4.  The idea was that by maintaining compatibility with both PHP4 and PHP5 we could help people transition from one to the other.  But now that the end of life for PHP 4 has been announced there isn't much point.  I don't know of any real projects that have been started using Zoop 1.50 so far and any new PHP projects should really start off with at least PHP 5.1.

Whether or not we will join gophp5.org and drop support for even PHP 5.1 is still up in the air.  If we rely on other projects that have joined gophp5.org and they really do break compatibility with PHP 5.1 or if PHP 5.2 has some killer features that we want to use then we may do the same.
